This directory contains some real-world examples of RSS::Tree,
selected from the approximately fifty classes that I use to help drive
my RSS feed consumption.

Most of those classes pull web content to replace the original feed
content, bypassing legitimate pageviews, and many remove
advertisements, both activities I feel ever-so-slightly guilty about.
That guilt is more than mitigated by the time savings I enjoy, as well
as the glow of accomplishment from hacking.  Nevertheless, I've chosen
these examples such that the above two activities are showcased in a
minimal way.
